# Uncommon Recursive Function Bug in JavaScript

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a recursive JavaScript function and its solution.

## Bug Description

The `myFunction` function aims to calculate a mathematical result recursively. However, it contains a flaw in its base cases and recursive calls, causing incorrect results or stack overflow errors for some input values.

## Bug Analysis

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of base cases and the recursive step.  The function does not correctly manage the conditions to prevent infinite recursion or produce incorrect answers.

## Solution

The solution corrects the base cases and the recursive call logic, ensuring the function accurately calculates the desired mathematical result for all valid input values. It prevents stack overflows by handling the base cases effectively and ensuring that the recursive calls always reduce the problem size.

## How to run the code

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js` to see the buggy code and `bugSolution.js` to see the corrected code.
3. You can run these files directly in a JavaScript environment (like a browser's developer console or Node.js).
